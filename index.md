## Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen make secret agreement

The war of words between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen has been brought to an end.

The pair met before the United States Grand Prix at the weekend to air out their differences after clashing in Mexico.

Hamilton claims he approached his young Red Bull rival to set the record straight.

Hamilton called Verstappen a crash “magnet” after the Dutchman hit Valtteri Bottas in Mexico.

But the Brit has since revealed he instigated talks over the weekend.

“I spoke to Max before the race,” Hamilton told Channel 4.

“I was like ‘dude, you are such a great racer man, let’s just squash whatever there is between us, whatever beef, let’s go out there and have a great race’.
